    "Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcome of an event that has one of two possible options. For example, tossing a coin - the outcome can either be heads or tails.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The probability of the two outcomes need not be the same. For a fair coin, the probability of heads is the same as tails. But, consider that the coin is not fair, then for example, the probability of heads could be 75% and tails would be 25%. Since the outcome is boolean, it can also be denoted as a success (with probability p) or failure (with probability q = 1 -p).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Also, each trial is considered independent, i.e. the outcome of a trial does not depend on the outcomes of other trials. Therefore, the probabiliy laws of independence can be used to determine the probability of events. Tossing a coin, drawing an item from a sample with replacement are examples of independent trials. The independent trials mean that we can multiply the probability of the first occurrence being success with the second occurrence being success and so on until the k occurrence.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note: if the trials are not independent, the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<h3><b>Probability mass function</b></h3>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For a random variable X that follows a binomial distribution, the probability of exactly k successes in n independent trials is given by:\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "k successes occur with probability $p^k$, we can use the multiplication rule because each trial is independent. Similary, n - k failures occur with probability $(1-p)^{(n-k)}$. However, the k successes can occur anywhere among the n trials, and there are $\\binom{n}{k}$ different ways of distributing the k successes in the sequence of n trials. The binomial coefficient is the same coefficient of the corresponding term in a binomial expansion state.\r\n",

    "$\r\n",
    "x can be probability of success, y is the probability of failure. If the probablility of atmost k successes is needed, then the sum of terms until $\\binom{n}{n-k}x^ky^{n-k}$ (inclusive) is used, if the probability of atleast k successes is needed, this represents the sum of all subsequent terms after $\\binom{n}{n-k}x^ky^{n-k}$. Also, since the sum of the probabilities of outcomes (x + y) is 1, then $P(X \\leq k) = 1 - P(X > k)$.\r\n",
